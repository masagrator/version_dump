It doesn't include games that don't have updates at all, all titleids end with `800` instead of `000` since `800` is for updates and `000` for base game.

Repository is automated and self-sufficient, it includes informations about newest update versions <ins>available to download from Nintendo servers</ins> (this is important because some updates are cartridge exclusive, for example "Umurangi Generation Special Edition" cartridge uses the same titleid as eshop version, but it contains 458752 update not available at day of writing this).
